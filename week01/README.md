From client we understood that:
- each Artist should have ID key attribute 
- Album should be identified based on its Artist and Name
- Track should be identified based on its Album and Name
- Finally it means, that this is weak entities and relations between them. That's why Name attribute of Track is partial key attribute and 	the Name of Album too. 
- Besides, there is only strict condition that Track can't exist without Album. Every Artist can have a lot of Albums.
