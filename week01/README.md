From client we understood that:
    each Artist should have ID key attribute 
    Album should be identified based on its Artist and Name
    Track should be identified based on its Album and Name
    Finally it means, that this is weak entities and relations between them. That's why Name attribute of Track is partial key attribute and 	the Name of Album too. 
    Besides, there is only strict condition that Track can't exist without Album. Every Artist can have a lot of Albums.
